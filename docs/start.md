<h1>What is Lootopia?</h1>

<p>We have to start on October 26th 2021, when <a href="https://twitter.com/TheMoonMidas">@TheMoonMidas</a> airdropped the entire total supply of SDOLLAR (15,240,278.55) to SpaceLoot holders. A cubic root formula was used to ensure fair and decentralized community distribution. The airdrop did not include any team allocations or presales. No more SDOLLAR will ever be minted.</p>

<p>In the coming months the DAO was formed (The Society), various NFTs have been created and dropped (Character sheets, Weapons, Lootopians, and Lootopian items), we created partnerships with Knowhere.art (sold NFTs using our currency, SDOLLAR) and Tfloki (using their solution, 'NFT as a service').</p>

<h4>Our many names</h4>
<p><b>Space Dollar</b> is the currency to be used for minting NFTs and transactions between Lootopians, when quests are implemented.</p>
<p><b>The Society</b> is our Discord community and DAO, where all the magic happens. Join us: <a href="https://discord.gg/ZfG9c5Hd">https://discord.gg/ZfG9c5Hd</a></p>
<p><b>Lootopia</b> is the brand of the broader ecosystem that we are adding "legoblocks" to.</p>
